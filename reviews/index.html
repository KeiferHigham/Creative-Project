          <p>Keifers Cafe was quite the experience, I had heard <br>
            good things about it from my colleagues, but I just <br>
            had to find out for myself. First of all let me just <br>
            say this, the views were out of this world!! I can't <br>
            think of a better view of the Maui Coast. I ordered <br>
            tuna steak and it did not dissapoint, It was obvious<br>
            that the Tuna was fresh, the sauce was incredible, a <br>
            a combination of seet with a little salty, the way it <br>
            it complemented the tuna was perfect. Overall I <br>
            would give Keifers Cafe a 9/10, I just told a couple <br>
            of my freinds about it, they definitely know what they <br>
            are doing here </p>

          <p>I grew up in Maui and during a trip home for the <br>
            holidays I decided to try Keifers Cafe. Growing up <br>
            here I loved the restaurants, and being major foodie<br>
            always thought that there could be something better.<br>
            Keifers restaurant blew my mind away, the took <br>
            advantage of the beautiful landscape in an amazing <br>
            way. Keifer was right about the food, I didn't think<br>
            it was possible but the foot actually was better than<br>
            the views! I decided to try the Lobster Pasta and <br>
            it did not dissapoint, perhabs the best Lobster I <br>
            have ever had in my entire life. The service was <br>
            amazing our waiter really cared about us and made <br>
            we had a great time. I would give Keifers Cafe a <br>
            10/10</p>

          <p> I have spent alot of time touring the world reviewing <br>
            restaurants with an emphasis in seafood, so when it <br>
            comes to the overall quality of a seafood restuarant no one <br>
            is a harsher critic than me. That being said, I fell in <br>
            love with Keifers Cafe the second I stepped inside. <br>
            The architecture of the builiding combined with the views<br>
            was amazing. I ordered lobster burger, and absolutely <br>
            loved it. It was cooked perfectly and the taste and texture<br>
            of the lobster was incredible. The service was great, one <br>
            of the best experiences I've had trying out a restaurant in <br>
            a long time. I would give Keifers Cafe a 10/10. </p>
